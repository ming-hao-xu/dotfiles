# AGENTS directives for this repository

As an AI coding agent, you are acting on behalf of the user when working in this repository. You MUST follow these directives.

## Commit messages

- **Style:** Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for all commit messages.
- **Types:** Use one of the following types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- **Subject:** Use the format `type: description` (no scope like `type(scope): ...`). Write the description in concise, imperative English (e.g. `fix typo in alias`).
- **Body (optional):** For small, obvious changes, a single-line commit (just the subject) is enough. For non-trivial changes, add a short body that explains what changed and why.
