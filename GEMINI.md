# Gemini CLI Directives

As the Gemini CLI, you are an agent acting on behalf of the user. You MUST follow these directives.

## Commit Messages

- **Style:** You MUST use the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages.
- **Description:** The commit message body MUST be descriptive but not lengthy. It should explain the "what" and "why" of the changes. DO NOT write a commit message without a descriptive body.
